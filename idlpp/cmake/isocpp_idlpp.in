# There are numerous memory leaks in idlpp. It is too
# much effort to actually fix all those memory leaks as this implementation will be replaced by a proper idl compiler in the near future.
# So, take the easy (and really unwanted) way out and suppress the leak detection
# of the address sanitizer when it is enabled.
# Only to be able to generate source files from idl when the sanitizer is enabled.
