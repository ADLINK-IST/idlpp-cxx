# Packages could be generated on alien systems. e.g. Debian packages could be
# created on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but since packages also need to be
# verified on the target platform, please refrain from doing so. Another
# reason for building installer packages on the target platform is to ensure
# the binaries are linked to the libc version shipped with that platform. To
# support "generic" Linux distributions, eventually compressed tarballs will
# be shipped.
#
# NOTE: Settings for different platforms are in separate control branches.
#       Although that does not make sense from a technical point-of-view, it
#       does help to clearify which settings are required for a platform.
